She was recently diagnosed with an iron level of 6 a few months ago. She was told to take iron twice a day for 3 months and then be checked. Her hand shakiness/tremor stopped while taking iron twice a day. She did a repeat lab and her lab came back at 37, which is on the low side but normal. So they had her drop down to 1 iron tab per day. Within a few days, her hand tremor/shakiness started again. Since it was during the weekend, I told her to go back up to 2 tabs and her tremor stopped! I spoke with her pediatrician who has known her since birth (she is a twin and was born at 37 1/2 weeks and has asthma (not bad) and anxiety ), and she doesn t think the iron has anything to do with the tremor. She said to let her go back to 2 pills a day for 3 months and then have her labs checked again. After that, switch her to a daily vitamin that has iron in it to see if that works. If it doesn t, she wants her to see a neurologist . Just wondering if you have any other thoughts or ideas about this.
