  "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Sometimes, it is not possible to distinguish between tuberculous (TB infection) and neurocysticercosis (tapeworm infection) on MRI brain. There are certain features such as size more than 2 cm, too much edema (swelling in brain), focal neurological deficits (such a weakness of arms or legs, etc.), which may favor a diagnosis of tuberculous. However, in many cases, we are forced to start treatment for either TB or tapeworm infection on empirical basis. Repeat scan after three months help us. If the size of lesion decreases, then good. If the size increases, then a biopsy (a small surgical procedure) of the brain lesion is done.  TB medications are safe.

  "Hi there, welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your question. Be rest assured that spinal stenosis is definitely not directly related to uveitis and high pressure in the eyes, thats is there is no 1 to 1 cause and effect relationship between them. Rheumatological conditions like Ankylosing Spondylitis are associated with a spectrum of disorder which include uveitis and back pain related to sacroiliac joint related inflammation. These are only associations and definitely there is a no cause and effect relationship between they. The association is due to the fact that the conditions affects certain soft tissue structures which form part of our eyes and some parts of our spine(the tests you have undergone have hopefully ruled out such conditions). It would be best to follow up with an ophthalmologist for your eye related issues. The spinal stenosis seen in your neck has no casual association with your eye related issues and would require follow up with a spinal surgeon. Hope this answers your question. All the best .

  "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. We talk about hypertension if we have mean values that exceeds 140/90 mmHg. It is normal to have higher blood pressure values after a physical or an emotional stress, so it is important to judge on mean day and night values. As you explain, you are diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, and you have done angioplasty. For this reason your blood pressures should be maintained under 140/90 mmHg. You mention that your mean values are over 140/90 mmHg, so my opinion as a cardiologist is that you should do changes in your medications. We have two strategies : the first one is to increase the existing doses or to add another antihypertensive medication. You didn't mention the actual dose of Medicare. Its maximal dosage might go up to 10 mg daily, but it is important to know your age and your heart frequency and I recommend consulting it with your cardiologist. Hope I was helpful.

  "Hi, The treatment of kidney stone disease depends on the size and location of stones. Small stones less than 5 mm in size, which are not causing any obstruction, can be managed conservatively with medicines to dissolve the stones. Stones 5 to 10 mm (maximum 15 mm) can be managed with lithography. Stones 10 to 15 mm can be manged with flexible ureteroscopy and laser. Stones more than 15 mm in size should be removed using PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) which is a keyhole surgery through the back. If the stone is blocking ureter (the tube connecting kidney and bladder) and is 5 to 10 mm in size, it can be treated with medicines to expel the stone. Stones larger than 10 mm usually require endoscopic removal, although occasionally ever a larger stone can be made to pass with medicines. The main issue in a young person like your brother is to find out whether there is an underlying predisposition to form recurrent stones. This is usually evaluated after removal of stones. The removed stone is analyzed to find out its chemical composition. You need to check his creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, uric acid and PTH (parathyroid hormone) levels in blood. It is important to check 24 hour urine levels of various salts which either promote or oppose stone formation. These include urinary volume, creatinine, sodium, calcium, uric acid, phosphorus, oxalate, citrate and magnesium levels. Based on these reports we can suggest dietary modifications and specific medications to prevent further stone formation.Meanwhile, ask him to Chat Doctor. 5 liters per day.
